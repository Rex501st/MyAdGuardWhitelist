# What is this
This is a list I made for my personal use on AdGuard products. This list is for myself, any issues or requests will be ignored.

# Why host this on GitHub then?



GitHub allows easy hosting, editing and allows all my devices to pull and push from one source.

# Can I fork this and use it for myself?



Of course! If you find it useful, feel free to! The internet after all was based on exchanging information and ideas!
